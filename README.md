# Software Design for Scientists

## *Chapter List:*

## What is Software?
* Something one tells a computer to do, no matter how small
* Should you write something?
* Improvements to science
* Finding and implementing what is already there
* Making it work
* Making it answer the questions you want it to

## User-Centered Design
* Who are your users?
* Think about software as always having a user who's not you
* General software design principles
* You're not going to necessarily become a great developer, but can be a pretty good developer by thinking of your code as having a life cycle
* Think beyond the script to do one experiment

## Steal, Share, Repeat 
* Participate in open source
* Two way street
* Everyone benefits
* Steal like a developer - learn & build on the code don't just slot in a pretty good solution because you don't know how to do it

## Scientific Reproducibility

* Requires codesharing as well as data sharing
* ... And there are so many good options!
* Requires a community to reuse and/or update the code.  

## The Scientific Method of Software: Agile

* Why agile will feel more natural to scientists (than waterfall)
* Agile isn't one thing and you don't have to follow a particular process
* Agile is a mindset not a process

## Data Artifacts Part 1:  Bugs

* Not letting your software work against you

## Data Artifacts Part 2:  Communicating Parameters

* Making sure that everyone gets the same answer, every time

## Software Solutions Part 1:  QA

* Pyunit 
* Flask and coverage.py for code coverage
* But what about R?

## Software Solutions Part 2:  Relatively Painless Documentation
* Documentation for science part
* Documentation for software part
* Keep em separate as practical
* Do both
* What software artifacts are most useful 
* Making it part of experimental design

## Database Design: Setting Yourself up to Make the Data Work for You and Others -- Not the Other Way Around.

* Solr faceting of flat files
* Organizing your data - think beyond relational databases 

## Scoping Data Science Projects, why it is the most important difficult thing you will ever do. 

## *Appendices:*

## Appendix 1: A glossary of useful terms, circa 2016.

## Appendix 2:  Some tools that might be useful to you.
